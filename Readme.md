# How to perform case sensitive filtering


<p><br />
The build with the capability to perform case sensitive filtering is not yet implemented. Please track our progress with the suggestion: <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/S37139">Allow case sensitive filtering in DXGrid</a><br />
At present, it is possible to use the GridControl.CustomRowFilter event to achieve this functionality.</p>
